# ImageWag Image Display App

## For [Konsool](https://badge.team/docs/badges/konsool/) and [Tanmatsu](https://docs.tanmatsu.cloud/) devices.
## Available in the [Tanmatsu App Repository](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/app-repository) for easy install.

Want to use your Konsool/Tanmatsu as a cool badge? 
This app will allow you to display and pick from multiple 800x480 images as well as flip them for optimal badge viewing.

## How to use

Loads all PNG images from root SD card. 

Each PNG should be less than 1.5MB and exactly 800px x 480px. Not sure how many images the device will play well with.

Use left & right arrow keys to navigate through images.
Use R key for random image.
Use F key to flip image upside down for badge mode.

If you see a purple background, something is probably wrong that hasn't been caught by an exception.

## Known Bugs

- Buttons may require multiple presses for something to happen
- App can crash while flipping through images
- Images flipped 180 degrees may show a 1px purple line on the bottom and left of the screen
